Because I'm stupid, How to get things somehow to work:

1. Pull latest cimgui and imgui
2. Modify cimgui/generator/generator.bat:
    2.1. set compiler to clang (thats the one that worked for me)
    2.2. add backends as arguments (win32 & dx11)
3. run generator.bat (command line has to be in generator folder!)
4. got to cimgui/cmakelists.txt
5. add the following filenames to IMGUI_SOURCES:
    #win32 backend
    cimgui/imgui/backends/imgui_impl_win32.cpp
    #dx11 backend
    cimgui/imgui/backends/imgui_impl_dx11.cpp

4. go back into imgui-beef directory
5. run "./build_cimgui.ps1 all" (this will run CMake, build release and debug, copy files to dependencies, compile Generator, run Generator)
6. done
